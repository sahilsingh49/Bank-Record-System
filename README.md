My C++ project revolves around developing a comprehensive bank record system. The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient software that enables bank employees to manage customer records, transactions, and account information seamlessly. The system will feature a secure login mechanism to ensure data confidentiality. Once logged in, bank personnel can perform various functions, including adding new customer details, updating existing records, and deleting obsolete information. Moreover, the system will facilitate smooth transaction processing, such as deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers between accounts. The bank record system will also include functionalities to generate reports summarizing customer data, account balances, and transaction histories, which can be exported for further analysis. Overall, this project aims to streamline banking operations, minimize manual efforts, and enhance the overall customer experience.
